# JARVIS
It listens, speaks, and acts — controlling your PC, fetching data, and powering real-world devices. Powered by Python, OpenAI’s API, and Raspberry Pi integration, it bridges software and physical automation. Speak naturally to launch apps, play music, toggle lights, or ask complex questions — just like Iron Man’s Jarvis.
